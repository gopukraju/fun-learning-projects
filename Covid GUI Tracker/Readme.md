Simple GUI tracker built with Tkinter library in Python. Interactively shows the current stats of Covid-19 cases. Also has an option to show country wise statistics of the virus. 

## Lessons Learned

- Got familiar with Tkinter, BeautifulSoup
- my first lessons on Web scraping
- As a beginner it was challenging to scrape the country-wise-stastistic
- Overcame that too by learning from different platforms.
